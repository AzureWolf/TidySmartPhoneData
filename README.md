## About the CodeBook.md

The CodeBook file in this repo provides insights into what information is represented in the tidySubjectActivity.txt file.
The final output, tidySubjectActivity.txt, contains 180 rows: 30 subjects performing 6 different actions.
THe data collected from those actions are the remaining columns.
The CodeBook will go into greater detail.
